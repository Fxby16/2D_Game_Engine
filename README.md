# 2D Game Engine
A work-in-progress 2D game engine made in c++ using opengl.

## Build
Run `make` to get the executable. If not specified, the program will be compiled in debug mode. To get better performance use `make DEBUG=0`

## Execute
Run `./main`

## Notes
- compiling the program in debug mode gives terrible results
- to use it on windows, you'll probably have to do some changes
